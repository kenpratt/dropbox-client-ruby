IMPORTANT: This library has been deprecated in favour of Dropbox Ruby SDK at: https://www.dropbox.com/developers/reference/sdk. All improvements made on this fork other than streaming downloads were incorporated into the Dropbox v1 Ruby SDK, and I moved streaming download support directly into https://github.com/kenpratt/dbox.

Originally forked from Dropbox v0 API Ruby client at https://www.dropbox.com/developers/releases and modified to shore up some issues with it.

Getting started with the Dropbox ruby library:
1. Make sure you have rake and rubygems installed on your system.
1b. Some of the gems below may need to be compiled locally, so make sure you
    have any necessary source code around as well.
    e.g. 'apt-get install ruby1.x-dev libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev' on ubuntu
2. Install oauth from rubygems
3. Install multipart-post from rubygems
4. Install json from rubygems
5. Install mechanize from rubygems
6. Install shoulda from rubygems
7. Copy config/testing.json.example to config/testing.json
8. In config/testing.json enter your application's consumer key, secret key,
   and your test user email and password.
9. Run 'rake test_units' to make sure all the tests pass.
10. Start developing your Dropbox API application!
